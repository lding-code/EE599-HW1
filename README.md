All functions (FindMedian + Factorial) asked in the homework are implemented in Solution class in solution.cc.
Compiling the main.cc and running the output file will print some basic output of the functions.
Multiple test cases are used to test the functions. Specific cases are explained in the solution_test.cc as comment.

* The FindMedian function can handle lists that are not sorted as it uses a Sort method (insertion sort) I added in the Solution class.
* Solution::Factorial() is for normal implementation.
* Solution::FactorialRec() is for recursive implementation.
